    <h2>A soup for both humans and animals to enjoy!</h2>
    <p>This is a little recipe I put together myself. I've been making it daily for as long as I can remember and the best thing is it never gets old! It is especially tasty on a hot summer day, so be sure to pack plenty for your next beach day! And without further ado here is the recipe:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hydrogen</li>
        <li>Oxygen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's it! You don't need anything else. One crucial point to remember is that it's important to maintain a strict 2:1 ratio of hydrogen to oxygen. Other than that, this is really all you need for this amazing dish!</p>
    <p>If you're feeling adventurous, feel free to add some ice cubes to taste. In all my years of making this dish, I have yet to meet someone who didn’t enjoy it. Some have asked about adding salt—and while you can, I usually advise against it unless you're preparing it for your fishy friends.</p>
