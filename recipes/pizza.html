    <h2>A beautiful pizza pie</h2>
    <p>It was a quiet summer night in 2002. I was watching Pokemon on VHS on the floor of my grandmas apartment. I was just a boy then. I had no idea this night would change my life forever. Who am I kidding, I'm no novelist. See below for the recipe.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>Pepperoni Slices (at least 8)</li>
        <li>Mozzarella Cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When it comes to quantities of each ingredient and how to actually make the pizza, just use your own judgment. I'm sure you can figure it out. However, I'll leave you with one tip: <em>you'll want to boil the pizza for about six hours or until the fire department shows up.</em></p>
